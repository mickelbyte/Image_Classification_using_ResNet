# Image Classification using Residual Neural Network (ResNet50) 
This notebook aims to build a classifier using deep learning that can predict whether a given image is a man or woman 
as well as the age range of the subject.

# Approach
1. Conducted investigative research on relevant ML technologies to scope feasibility of project and settled on Deep Learning and evaluated ResNet model as a relevant choice. 
2. Obtained relevant preprepared image data set from Kaggle called, IMDB-Clean.  
3. Conducted preliminary data analysis and created new dataset class for CSV files provided by the data set for training and validation. 
4. Further optimised code to handle memory issues when training model. 
5. ResNET50 model built. 

# To Do
Finish running code and evaluate results and write conclusion
Further improvements to be made to model as identified according to paper by Ali et.al (2020)
